            <p style="font-size: 20px;" style="color: white;">
             My personal opinion of the movie, is that it is indeed fun, I like the dialogue, many cameo's,<br/>
            good script, good acting and ryan reynolds never miss being deadpool, the wait is worth it,<br/>
            The fight is is Epic, them fighting around each other and fighting a bunch of enemy is goated<br/>
            the duo defeats Cassandra Nova by disabling the Time Ripper and stopping the villain from <br/>
            destroying the multiverse. Deadpool and Wolverine both survive.
             <br/>The ending shows Wade wilson a.k.a <u>DEADPOOL</u>'s World which is his friends and family 
             The ending
